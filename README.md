# 510 - Data Service Catalogue
This is the data catalogue of 510, an initiative of the Netherlands Red Cross, hosted and maintained by the Data Team of the Netherlands Red Cross. 

The Data Team is responsible for supporting the NS in responding timely to humanitarian needs in-country by owning their data products and services for accurate, reliable and targeted decision-making. 

## What is the Data Service Catalogue 
Data Service Catalogue is a centralised repository for documenting and organising our data-related services (incl. datasets, databases, APIs, data pipelines, reports, and analytics tools).​

Data Service Catalogue serves as an overview of the services that we can provide and sums up requirements for deploying and/or sustaining the service. It can also be used as a guideline in conversations with Information Managers (IM) from the NS when exploring the feasibility of these services.

## Why is there a Data Service Catalogue

* Data Governance establish and enforce data governance policies, documentation of data lineage, quality standards, usage guidelines and access controls.  ​
* Facilitates collaboration among the team by creating visibility into available data assets. Encourage cross-functional teams to work together on projects, share insights and avoid data silos.​
* Clear overview to promoting ‘standardised’ services with a level of maturity that we know how to deploy​
* Allows NLRC to track the lineage from source to final implementation, leading to creating an understanding of the impact of changes, ensuring data accuracy and troubleshooting issues.
* Resource optimization to avoid duplication of efforts. ​
* Align data initiatives with business objectives, to make informed decisions and drive innovation within the country strategy and data strategy of NLRC. ​​
* Providing insights to record data usage and access ​
